## Description

A social media app where users can share moments in time through photos and videos and their thoughts about them with friends! Connect and keep up to date with what friends are doing.

## Installation

For Windows, please download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

macOS users will need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Then, run `brew install git` to install git, and `brew install node` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source if you swing that way.

After that, [clone the Application](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

When the cloning is done, open the Integrated Terminal in the respective directory.

Run the following command in the terminal to install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

To send API calls, it would be very useful to download an API client (ie. Insomnia)
